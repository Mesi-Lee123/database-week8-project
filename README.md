# Library Management Database

## Overview
The **Library Management Database** is a fully normalized (3NF) relational database designed to manage library operations. It tracks books, authors, categories, members, and loan activities. The database is implemented in **MySQL** with proper indexing, foreign key constraints, and query optimization strategies.

## Relationship Overview

| Table 1     | Table 2     | Relationship   | Description |
|------------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Authors    | BookAuthors | Many-to-Many   | A book can have multiple authors and an author can write multiple books. |
| Categories | Books       | One-to-Many    | Each book belongs to one category. |
| Books      | Loans       | One-to-Many    | A book can have multiple loans. |
| Members    | Loans       | One-to-Many    | A member can have multiple loans. |

All relationships enforce **foreign key constraints** to maintain **referential integrity**.

## Normalization & Optimization

- Fully normalized **up to 3NF**:
  - No repeating groups.
  - All non-key attributes depend on the whole primary key.
  - No transitive dependencies.
- Indexes on frequently queried columns for faster performance.
- Composite primary key in `BookAuthors` prevents duplicate book-author entries.
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.
- Unique constraints on `isbn`, `email`, and `category_name` prevent duplicates.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Create Database:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;
USE LibraryDB;
````

2. **Run Table Creation Scripts** (SQL file) to create all tables with constraints and indexes.

3. **Insert Sample Data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Categories(category_name) VALUES ('Fiction');
INSERT INTO Authors(first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Jane', 'Austen');
INSERT INTO Books(title, isbn, category_id, published_year, total_copies)
VALUES ('Pride and Prejudice', '111-222333444', 1, 1813, 5);
```

4. **Query Examples:**

* **Find all books by a specific author:**

```sql
SELECT b.title, b.isbn
FROM Books b
JOIN BookAuthors ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
JOIN Authors a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE a.last_name = 'Austen';
```

* **List overdue books:**

```sql
SELECT l.loan_id, m.first_name, m.last_name, b.title
FROM Loans l
JOIN Members m ON l.member_id = m.member_id
JOIN Books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE l.status = 'overdue';
```

---

## Notes

* Scalable for large libraries with thousands of books, members, and loans.
* Can be extended with `BookCopies`, `Staff`, or `MemberAddresses` tables.
* Optimized for query performance using indexes and foreign key constraints.
